      Bundled Discounts Plug-in for nopCommerce enables the store owner to enhance sales by offering discounts on purchase of additional products along with the one that customer wants to buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The store owner can create bundle(s) on a product (base product) and set discount amount to be levied on purchase of that bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Store owner can add discount for bundles and link additional products to base product in each bundle. Customer will get some discount(as per configured discount) on purchase of that bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Customer can view bundle offers on product details page of the base product. Customer can directly add to cart bundle products from product detail page and if some bundle products have attributes then plug-in will show pop-up window for attribute configuration.

      nopAccelerate Plus Pro is completely different compared to nopAccelerate. We started nopAccelerate in 2013-14 and since we see a lot of change in nopCommerce architecture which allows to design and develop the new integration plugin in the more proficient and modern way, something which can be integrated effortlessly in a more standard way. This time our product will be more compatible with other themes & plugins and is easier to extend and maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      nopAccelerate Plus Pro includes Search & Facets features as well that makes it different from nopAccelerate Plus Search.
