      <li>Open nopAccelerate plus => nopAccelerate+ search => Configure page to download the setup required files on Remote server.</li>
      <li>Find the <strong>'Setup files download'</strong> option & download the required setup files by clicking the button which will download the zip file.</li>
      <li>Unzip the file which contains 3 files: db-data-config.xml, solrconfig.xml, and synonyms.txt. Copy these files and paste them into the Conf folder of your Solr Data Directory. Once done, please reload the Core from Solr Admin.</li>
      <li>Before connecting to SQL Server database from Solr, install Microsoft JDBC Driver into Solr. Copy sqljdbc42.jar file from the extracted folder and paste it into Solr's lib folder for dataimporthandler. On Windows, it should be at <strong>C:\solr-7.5.0\contrib\dataimporthandler\lib.</strong> Please create the folder if it's not already there.</li>
      <li>Once youâ€™ve completed the manual setup, click on the Reload Button of the Configure page to Reload the Core to apply the changes.</li>
      <li>Go to Core setup again; this time the Request Handler will be configured correctly, so you just need to manually update the setting for DbConfigFileStatus to true and perform indexing.</li>
      <li>If indexing works, it means you have correctly set up the remote core setup.</li>
